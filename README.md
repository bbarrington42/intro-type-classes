# intro-type-classes
Basis of Introduction to Type Classes presented at Atlanta Scala Users Group March 16, 2016

The original inspiration for this topic came from <https://github.com/scopt/scopt>, a command line interpreter written 
in scala.

I also borrowed from the following online examples:

<http://www.smartjava.org/content/scala-typeclass-explained-implement-stringread-function> (String read function)
 and <http://www.casualmiracles.com/2012/05/03/a-small-example-of-the-typeclass-pattern-in-scala/> (a Transformer).
